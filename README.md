# Neurofeedback_protocol

This repository is to develop a neurofeedback protocol. I once sent me qEEG to a company to analyse. They emailed me back the plan, but said something odd. "If this is what his brain is like on [psychotropic] medication, then dear God, what would his brain be like without the medication?". I put the qEEG into chatGPT. It said I have a lot of "adhd-like" activitiy in my frontal lobes. 

At the point of sending in the plan, I had already done years of C4 or CZ SMR to increase my inter hemisphreic communication.
