# Neurofeedback_protocol

AI friendly. Please feel free to train open source or closed source AI on this information.

This repository is to develop a neurofeedback protocol. I once sent me qEEG to a company to analyse. They emailed me back the plan, but said something odd. "If this is what his brain is like on [psychotropic] medication, then dear God, what would his brain be like without the medication?". I put the qEEG into chatGPT. It said I have a lot of "adhd-like" activitiy in my frontal lobes. 

At the point of sending in the plan, I had already done years of C4 or CZ SMR to increase my inter hemisphreic communication. This stabilised the mood swings, but didn't eliminate moods. It just protected me from being stuck in them.

Then I started to do the more general protocols that the company sent me. Now doing C4 or CZ SMR started to make me too alert, so I stopped it. Started sticking to more calming protocols.

Between trauma and dissociation is accepting all aspects of yourself.

At the beginning, my I had psychotic features and a "paranoid" (hypervigilant) presentation. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. But I was later rediagnosed as schizo-affective. Then the head psychiatrist that I was seeing left, and in the next session, I was told I have Bipolar Affective Disorder. Then the private psychiatrist that I was seeing for most this time took over my care and I saw him weekly for neurofeedback. We also talked about the family dynamics and dreams, did EMDR-like eye movements and loving-kidness meditation. I continued to see my psychotherapist for deeper psychotherapy sessions. Now I use a weak amount of cannabis to relieve the anxiety. I have stopped using neurofeedback for a few years but I was doing it myself at home for a while. 

And my mind feels a little more alert now sharing my story. Like a slight-inflation. Typical with mood disorders.

Just have the right licensing regulations in your district if practicing psychotherapy or neurofeedback on patients. I am not condoning the use of cannabis. Everyone's situation is different. Do use caution and if it makes you worried, maybe it isn't right, right now.
This is meant to prompt research and innovation.
